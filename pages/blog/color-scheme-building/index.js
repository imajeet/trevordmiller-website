              I wanted the project to be easy to maintain, so I decided to
              create a source module called{' '}

              that could contain all of the color values (organized by color
              meaning), and then use this module in the repo for each editor and
              tool so that they could all be updated from the same source. I did
              this for editors (Vim, Atom), terminal emulators (Hyper, iTerm),
              and other tools (Git, tmux). Here is an example of{' '}

              I would recommend using a shared location for source values for
              things like style guides and color schemes, with a compile step -
              it makes using and maintaining them a lot easier ;)
