              A common way to share stateful logic across React components is
              using the "Higher Order Components" (HOC) pattern. This post will
              show an alternative that I feel is simpler and more flexible
              called "Render Callback components" (AKA Function as Child
              components).
            </Paragraph>
          </div>
        ),

        title: `What is a Render Callback?`,
        component: (
          <div>
            <Paragraph>
              A "Render Callback" is a component where the <Code>children</Code>{' '}
              prop is a function; then shared logic is accessed through the
              function's arguments. Render Callbacks are just functions - just
              JavaScript!
            </Paragraph>
          </div>
        ),
      },

      {

        component: (
          <div>
            <Heading level={4}>Define</Heading>
            <Paragraph>
              To define a Render Callback you return{' '}
              <Code>this.props.children</Code> (a function) with the arguments
              you want to share.
            </Paragraph>
            <CodeBlock file="SharedThing.js">{exampleDefine}</CodeBlock>

            <Heading level={4}>Use</Heading>
            <Paragraph>
              To use a Render Callback you write an inline function with the
              arguments you've shared.
            </Paragraph>
            <CodeBlock file="AnotherComponent.js">{exampleUse}</CodeBlock>
          </div>
        ),
      },

      {
        title: `Practical Example`,
        component: (
          <div>
            <Paragraph>
              We have three components: an <Code>Accordion</Code>,{' '}
              <Code>Modal</Code>, and <Code>Thumbnail</Code>. Here is an example{' '}
              <Code>App</Code> using all three and showing their output; tap the
              output to interact with each component and compare how they are
              similiar.
            </Paragraph>

            <CodeBlock fileName="App.js" output={<ExampleApp />}>
              {exampleApp}
            </CodeBlock>

            <Paragraph>
              What is common between them? They all can be "toggled"
              open/closed. We could write each of them as a stateful class
              component with the same wrapping code, but since they have the
              same state setup - let's share it! Let's abstract the state into a{' '}
              <Code>Toggle</Code> component (a Render Callback).
            </Paragraph>

            <CodeBlock fileName="Toggle.js">{exampleToggle}</CodeBlock>

            <Paragraph>
              Now components that use <Code>Toggle</Code> will have access to
              their own <Code>isOpen</Code> and <Code>handleToggleClick</Code>{' '}
              arguments without having to wire up the state code. The instances
              of <Code>Toggle</Code> (<Code>Accordion</Code>, <Code>Modal</Code>,
              and <Code>Thumbnail</Code>) can just be stateless function
              components.
            </Paragraph>

            <CodeBlock fileName="Accordion.js">{exampleAccordion}</CodeBlock>

            <CodeBlock fileName="Modal.js">{exampleModal}</CodeBlock>

            <CodeBlock fileName="Thumbnail.js">{exampleThumbnail}</CodeBlock>

              These examples are available in a working app in a GitHub repo if
              you want to fork or clone it to try it out.
            </Paragraph>
            <Anchor href="https://github.com/trevordmiller/example-render-callback">
              <Button>View example repo</Button>

              Although there are a few ways to share stateful logic across
              components in React, I feel that the Render Callback pattern is
              the most flexible and simple. All you need to remember is to pass
              a function as the <Code>children</Code> and then use the
              arguments!
            </Paragraph>
          </div>
        ),
      },
    ]}
